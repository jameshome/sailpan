      <h1>How SailPan works</h1>

      <p>
        Passagemaking was challenging enough before the global pandemic. Now,
        liveaboard sailors and ocean voyagers are contending with new
        uncertainties as the communities around the ports and anchorages we rely
        on decide how to protect themselves from COVID-19. While these are real
        new challenges, rumors often paint an even bleaker picture than the
        reality, and the facts we need to plan our passages are often buried
        several posts deep in a hard to find comment thread, quickly relayed on
        a radio net, or mentioned in passing on the docks.
      </p>

      <p>
        That's where SailPan comes in. SailPan provides sailors with a daily
        digest of reported changes to critical ports, anchorages, channels, and
        towns in the region. Reports come in from officials, marinas, and boats.
        Whenever possible, sources are shown to give you a way to follow up. All
        tracked locations are shown on the map. Pins are colored to show our
        best understanding of the status of each location. You can click on any
        location to see an archive of reports related to that place.
      </p>

      <p>
        What you won't find on SailPan is opinion or conversation. Sailors need
        the scuttlebutt now more than ever, but there are already dozens of
        amazing communities out there, and we'd rather send you to them for the
        conversation. For many reports, you'll find links to the communities
        where that news is being discussed, and we encourage you to participate
        in the conversations there.
      </p>

      <h2>REGIONS</h2>
      <p>
        SailPan divides the world into regions. Right now, there's only one
        region, covering Pacific Mexico, the Gulf of California, and popular
        adjacent destinations. This isn't a technical limitation — the site is
        designed to acommodate dozens of regions. We're looking for more editors
        who are interested in managing SailPan reports in their region. If
        that's you, please get in touch.
