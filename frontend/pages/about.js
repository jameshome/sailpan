        <h1>How SailPan Works</h1>
      </div>
      <p>
        <b>Passagemaking was challenging before the global pandemic.</b> Now we
        sailors are contending with new uncertainties as the ports and
        anchorages we rely on make hard decisions about how to best protect
        their communities from COVID-19. The facts we need to plan our passages
        are often buried several posts deep in comment threads on social
        networks, relayed quickly on a radio net, or mentioned in passing on the
        docks, making it hard to separate rumor from reality.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>
          SailPan makes things easier for the passagemaking sailor by providing
          a regularly updated map and digest of reports covering changes to
          important locations.
        </b>
      </p>
      <h2>REPORTS</h2>
      <p>Each report is categorized by where it came from:</p>
      <p
        className="withicon"
        style={{ backgroundImage: "url(../img/icon-report-boatreport.png)" }}
      >
        BOAT REPORT
        <br />
        Boat Reports come in from boats at sea. These first hand reports often
        bring the most timely information available. We receive some of these
        directly, and find others on regional social networks and message
        boards.
      </p>
      <p
        className="withicon"
        style={{
          backgroundImage: "url(../img/icon-report-localknowledge.png)",
        }}
      >
        LOCAL KNOWLEDGE
        <br />
        Similar to Boat Reports, these come in from local land-based regional
        experts who are engaged with the sailing community.
      </p>
      <p
        className="withicon"
        style={{
          backgroundImage: "url(../img/icon-report-officialnotice.png)",
        }}
      >
        OFFICIAL NOTICE
        <br />
        Usually issued by a government agency, Official Notices often report
        major changes to multiple locations in the region.
      </p>
      <p
        className="withicon"
        style={{
          backgroundImage: "url(../img/icon-report-marinaannouncement.png)",
        }}
      >
        MARINA ANNOUNCEMENT
        <br />
        Marina Announcements are made by marina harbormasters and can cover port
        status, availability, price changes, and openings and closures.
      </p>
      <p>
        Below each report, you'll find a list of specific sources which link to
        more information or to the communities where the report is being
        discussed. You won't find opinion or conversation on SailPan, and we
        encourage you to follow these links to join in the discussion.
      </p>
      <h2>LOCATIONS</h2>
      <p>
        Reports cover one or more locations. A location might be a port,
        anchorage, marina, state, city or town. The pin for each location is
        colored to show our understanding of its current status:

      >
        UNCERTAIN
        <br />
        Conflicting or confusing information reported

      <p
